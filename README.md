# This is my home webserver repo.
# I have many various hand-crafted HTML pages, as well as a few mostly hand-crafted PHP pages.
# If you clone this repo and try to use it, but something does not work, let me know, as I did not upload certain items for the sake of security and privacy.
# (Also, some are not my work and I do not want to take the credit for them)
